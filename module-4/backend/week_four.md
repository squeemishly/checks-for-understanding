6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
```
It helps you find code that causes problems much faster, which will invariably lead to faster solutions. It also communicates the solutions you've found to your team so they don't need to work to find the same solutions. CI tools will also check to make sure the code you wrote didn't break any tests so you don't end up inadvertantly pushing up problems for the future. 
```

7. What are some continuous integration tools?
```
Travis CI
```
